## Vehicle Simulator in MonoGame feat. FMOD Audio Engine

This is a vehicle simulator that I built in C# using the MonoGame game framework, used by many indie game developers to build critically-acclaimed video games. To spice things up, I also used the FMOD audio engine, used by many AAA and indie game studios for high quality audio playback.

The project was a fun demonstration of a couple of things; firstly, this was my first "serious" project in C# and Dotnet. I say "serious" since this was rather simple to pick up, coming from a C/C++ background.
Secondly, it put my game design and game programming skills into practice; I had previous experience doing game jams, but this was my first time I got to make something that resembles production-level gameplay.
Thirdly, I was able to integrate the FMOD audio engine, whose only reference material is the official documentation; most other information online pertaining to FMOD is always as a plugin for the Unity or Unreal game engines, so it really put to perspective how I integrated an industry-standard technology into my codebase.

Here is a demo videos showcasing the game in action:
